# Face-Mask-Detection

Hello, we are going to introduce you to the mask wearing detection and verification application we have designed!

Unlike the vast majority of applications currently available on the market, our innovative system not only detects whether the mask is worn or not, but also whether the mask is worn correctly or incorrectly.

It was important to us in times of a health crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing to develop an application that can enforce the correct wearing of the mask.

Furthermore, this software can also be used to establish better traceability of contact cases in the public space, the aim not being to reprimand individuals but to slow down the epidemic.
